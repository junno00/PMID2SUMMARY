The last decade has seen many exciting technological breakthroughs that greatly expanded the toolboxes for biological and biomedical research, yet few have had more impact than induced pluripotent stem cells and modern-day genome editing. These technologies are providing unprecedented opportunities to improve physiological relevance of experimental models, further our understanding of developmental processes, and develop novel therapies. One of the research areas that benefit greatly from these technological advances is the three-dimensional human organoid culture systems that resemble human tissues morphologically and physiologically. Here we summarize the development of human pluripotent stem cells and their differentiation through organoid formation. We further discuss how genetic modifications, genome editing in particular, were applied to answer basic biological and biomedical questions using organoid cultures of both somatic and pluripotent stem cell origins. Finally, we discuss the potential challenges of applying human pluripotent stem cell and organoid technologies for safety and efficiency evaluation of emerging genome editing tools.
