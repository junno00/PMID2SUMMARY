Extensive studies have demonstrated that transcription factors are the key to stem cell lineage commitment and differentiation efficacy. As the transcription factor profile varies depending on the cell type, global transcriptome analysis through RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has been a powerful tool for measuring and characterizing the success of stem cell differentiation. RNAseq has been utilized to comprehend how gene expression changes as cells differentiate and provide a guide to inducing cellular differentiation based on promoting the expression of specific genes. It has also been utilized to determine the specific cell type. This review highlights RNAseq techniques, tools for RNAseq data interpretation, RNAseq data analytic methods and their utilities, and transcriptomics-enabled human stem cell differentiation. In addition, the review outlines the potential benefits of the transcriptomics-aided discovery of intrinsic factors influencing stem cell lineage commitment, transcriptomics applied to disease physiology studies using patients' induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells for regenerative medicine, and the future outlook on the technology and its implementation.","RNA sequencing and data analysis; differential gene expression; human stem cell differentiation; transcriptomics","","","en","Review"

Functional characterization of these factors remains challenging, particularly because of the lack of human model systems. Molecular and nanotechnological advances, in particular the ability to generate patient-specific PSC lines, differentiate them into diverse cell types, and seed and combine them on microfluidic chips, have led to the establishment of organ-on-a-chip (OoC) platforms that recapitulate organ biology. OoC technology thus provides unique personalized platforms for studying the effects of host genetics and environmental factors on organ physiology. In this review we describe the technology and provide examples of how OoCs may be used for disease modeling and pharmacogenetic research.","iPSCs; intestine-on-a-chip; liver-on-a-chip; organ-on-a-chip; personalized medicine; pharmacogenomics; vessel-on-a-chip","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","en","Review"

However, in order to industrialize iPSC-derived therapies, it is necessary to address the existing challenges surrounding the analytics implemented in the manufacturing process to evaluate and monitor cell expansion, differentiation, and quality of the final products. Here, we review some of the key analytical methods used as part of identity, potency, or safety for in-process or final product release testing and highlighted the challenges and potential solutions for consideration in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) strategy for iPSC-based therapies. Some of the challenges associated with characterization and testing of iPSC-based products are related to the choice of analytical technology (to ensure fit-for-purpose), assay reliability and robustness. Automation of analytical methods may be required to reduce hands on time, and improve reliability of the methods through reducing assay variability. Indeed, we have shown that automation of analytical methods is feasible (evaluated using an ELISA based assay) and would result in more precise measurements (demonstrated by lower co-efficient of Variation and standard deviation), less hands-on time, and swift compared to a manually run assay. Therefore, in order to support commercialization of iPSC-based therapies we suggest a well-designed testing strategy to be established in the development phase while incorporating robust, reproducible, reliable, and potentially automated analytics in the manufacturing process.","Analytical methods; Assay robustness; Automation; Cell therapies; iPSCs","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","en","Review"

Since the discovery of iPSCs in 2006, many advanced techniques have been introduced to differentiate iPSCs to cardiomyocytes, which have been progressively improved. The disease models from iPSC-induced cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have been successfully helping to study a variety of cardiac diseases such as long QT syndrome, drug-induced long QT, different cardiomyopathies related to mutations in mitochondria or desmosomal proteins and other rare genetic diseases. IPSC-CMs have also been used to screen the role of chemicals in cardiovascular drug discovery and individualisation of drug dosages. In this review, the quality of current procedures for characterisation and maturation of iPSC-CM lines will be discussed. Also, we will focus on time efficiency and cost of standard differentiation methods after reprogramming.","cost effectiveness; drug screening tests; iPSC-CMs; maturation","","","en","Review"

Hence, several studies have been performed harnessing their salutary properties in regenerative medicine. Despite several challenges associated with the clinical applications of PSCs, worldwide efforts are harnessing their potential in the regeneration of damaged tissues. Several clinical trials have been performed using PSCs or their derivatives. However, the delay in publishing the data obtained in the trials has led to a lack of awareness about their outcomes, resulting in apprehension about cellular therapies. Here, the authors review the published papers containing data from recent clinical trials done with PSCs. PSC-derived extracellular vesicles hold great potential in regenerative therapy. Since published papers containing the data obtained in clinical trials on PSC-derived extracellular vesicles are not available yet, the authors have reviewed some of the pre-clinical work done with them.","clinical trials; embryonic stem cells; extracellular vesicles; induced pluripotent stem cells; pre-clinical studies","","","en","Review"

In addition, due to its independence from the pluripotent state, direct programming minimizes some safety concerns associated with the use of human pluripotent stem cells. However, the significant limitations of reprogrammed cells, such as poor proliferative ability, low efficiency, and immature function, need to be addressed before the clinical application potential can be expanded. Here, we review the recent achievements of direct reprogramming in 2D and 3D systems in vitro and in vivo, covering cells derived from the three germ layers from stem/progenitor cells to terminal cells, such as hepatocytes, pancreatic β cells, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, neurons, and melanocytes. Combining our lab experiences with current work, we summarize the practical and potential issues that need to be solved and the prospects of strategies for addressing the current dilemmas. Through comprehensive analyses, it is concluded that the directions for dealing with efficiency and functionality issues could be the optimization of transcription factors, the upgradation for delivery systems, the regulation of epigenetic factors and pathways, and the improvement of cellular maintenance conditions. Besides, converting cells into the progenitor state firstly and then differentiating them into the desired cell types with chemical compounds may provide an approach to obtaining functional and safe converted cells in batches with a better proliferative ability. With the emergence of more and more direct reprogramming techniques and approaches with both safety and effectiveness, it is bound to bring a new dawn for mechanism research and therapeutic applications for relevant diseases in the future.","","","","en","Review"

These qualities mean that iPSCs are rapidly becoming established as viable and powerful model systems with which it is possible to address questions in human evolution that were until now logistically and ethically intractable, especially in the quest to understand humans' place among the great apes, and the genetic basis of human uniqueness. In this review, we discuss the key lessons and takeaways of this nascent field; from the types of research, iPSCs make possible to lingering challenges and likely future directions. We provide a comprehensive overview of how the seemingly unlikely combination of iPSCs and explicit evolutionary frameworks is transforming what is possible in our understanding of humanity's past and present.","development; gene expression; human evolution; stem cells; tissue models","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","en","Review"

The iPSC technology provides a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms of cellular differentiation and cell fate decision as well as to study targets and pathways relevant to pathological processes. As they can be generated from any person, iPSCs are a promising resource for regenerative medicine potentiating the possibility to discover new drugs in a high-throughput screening format and treat diseases through personalized cell therapy-based strategies. However, the reprogramming process is complex, and its regulation needs fine tuning. The regulatory mechanisms of cell reprogramming and differentiation are still not elucidated, but significant results show that multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles. In this mini-review, we discuss the latest research on lncRNAs in iPSC stemness, neuronal, and cardiac differentiation.","differentiation; iPSC; lncRNA; stemness","","","en","Review"

Primary human hepatocytes are the gold standard for the prediction and successful treatment of liver disease. However, the sources of hepatocytes for drug toxicity testing and disease modeling are limited. To overcome this issue, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have emerged as an alternative strategy for liver disease therapy. Human PSCs, including embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can self-renew and give rise to all cells of the body. Human PSCs are attractive cell sources for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, drug discovery, and developmental studies. Several recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can also differentiate (or trans-differentiate) into hepatocytes. Differentiation of human PSCs and MSCs into functional hepatocytelike cells (HLCs) opens new strategies to study genetic diseases, hepatotoxicity, infection of hepatotropic viruses, and analyze hepatic biology. Numerous in vitro and in vivo differentiation protocols have been established to obtain human PSCs/MSCs-derived HLCs and mimic their characteristics. It was recently discovered that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in controlling the ectopic expression of transcription factors and governing the hepatocyte differentiation of human PSCs and MSCs. In this review, we focused on the role of miRNAs in the differentiation of human PSCs and MSCs into hepatocytes.","Liver diseases; hepatocytes; induced pluripotent stem cells; mesenchymal stem cells; microRNAs; pluripotent stem cells","","","en","Review"

Stem cell differentiation plays critical roles in body homoeostasis, injury repair and tissue generation. The important functions of stem cell differentiation have resulted in numerous studies focusing on the complex molecular mechanisms and various signalling pathways controlling stem cell differentiation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs with a covalently closed structure present in eukaryotes. Numerous studies have highlighted important biological functions of circRNAs, and they play multiple regulatory roles in various physiological and pathological processes.

The initial human iPSC studies used fibroblasts as a starting cell source to reprogram them; however, it has been identified to be a less appealing somatic cell source by numerous studies due to various reasons. One of the important criteria to achieve efficient reprogramming is determining an appropriate starting somatic cell type to induce pluripotency since the cellular source has a major influence on the reprogramming efficiency, kinetics, and quality of iPSCs. Therefore, numerous groups have explored various somatic cell sources to identify the promising sources for reprogramming into iPSCs with different reprogramming factor combinations. This review provides an overview of promising easily accessible somatic cell sources isolated in non-invasive or minimally invasive manner such as keratinocytes, urine cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells used for the generation of human iPSCs derived from healthy and diseased subjects. Notably, iPSCs generated from one of these cell types derived from the patient will offer ethical and clinical advantages. In addition, these promising somatic cell sources have the potential to efficiently generate bona fide iPSCs with improved reprogramming efficiency and faster kinetics. This knowledge will help in establishing strategies for safe and efficient reprogramming and the generation of patient-specific iPSCs from these cell types.","Induced pluripotent stem cells; Keratinocytes; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; Somatic cells; Urine cells","","","en","Review"

Over the past 15 years, the advanced development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has displayed an unparalleled potential for regenerative medicine, cell-based therapies, modeling human diseases in culture, and drug discovery. The transcription factor quartet (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) reprograms highly differentiated somatic cells back to a pluripotent state recapitulated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in different aspects, including gene expression profile, epigenetic signature, and functional pluripotency. With the prior fruitful studies in SCNT and cell fusion experiments, iPSC finds its place and implicates that the differentiated somatic epigenome retains plasticity for re-gaining the pluripotency and further stretchability to reach a totipotency-like state. These achievements have revolutionized the concept and created a new avenue in biomedical sciences for clinical applications. With the advent of 15 years' progress-making after iPSC discovery, this review is focused on how the current concept is established by revisiting those essential landmark studies and summarizing its current biomedical applications status to facilitate the new era entry of regenerative therapy.","Col1a1 4F2A Oct4-GFP reprogrammable mouse; expanded potential stem cell (EPSC); expanded potential stem cell medium (EPSCM); induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC); somatic reprogramming; stochastic and deterministic model","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","en","Review"

Epigenetic mechanisms based largely on DNA methylation and histone modifications serve to reinforce and safeguard differentiated cell states. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-MYC (OSKM) can erase somatic cell identity and reprogram the cells to a pluripotent state. In doing so, reprogramming must reset the chromatin landscape, silence somatic-specific gene expression programs, and, in their place, activate the pluripotency network. In this viewpoint, we consider the major chromatin-based barriers for reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. Among these, repressive chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation, H3K9 methylation, variant histone deposition, and histone deacetylation generally block the activation of pluripotency genes. In contrast, active transcription-associated chromatin marks such as DOT1L-catalyzed H3K79 methylation, FACT-mediated histone turnover, active enhancer SUMOylation, and EP300/CBP bromodomain-mediated interactions act to maintain somatic-specific gene expression programs. We highlight how genetic or chemical inhibition of both types of barriers can enhance the kinetics and/or efficiency of reprogramming. Understanding the mechanisms by which these barriers function provides insight into how chromatin marks help maintain cell identity.","chromatin; epigenetics; pluripotent stem cells; reprogramming","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","en","Review"

Dendritic cell-based vaccines are being explored to reactivate anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T) were however the main approaches that catapulted the therapeutic success of immunotherapy. Despite their success across a broad range of human cancers, many challenges remain for basic understanding and clinical progress as only a minority of patients benefit from immunotherapy. In addition, cellular immunotherapies face important limitations imposed by the availability and quality of immune cells isolated from donors. Cell fate reprogramming is offering interesting alternatives to meet these challenges. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology not only enables studying immune cell specification but also serves as a platform for the differentiation of a myriad of clinically useful immune cells including T-cells, NK cells, or monocytes at scale. Moreover, the utilization of iPSCs allows introduction of genetic modifications and generation of T/NK cells with enhanced anti-tumor properties. Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, can also be generated by direct cellular reprogramming employing lineage-specific master regulators bypassing the pluripotent stage. Thus, the cellular reprogramming toolbox is now providing the means to address the potential of patient-tailored immune cell types for cancer immunotherapy. In parallel, development of viral vectors for gene delivery has opened the door for in vivo reprogramming in regenerative medicine, an elegant strategy circumventing the current limitations of in vitro cell manipulation. An analogous paradigm has been recently developed in cancer immunotherapy by the generation of CAR T-cells in vivo. These new ideas on endogenous reprogramming, cross-fertilized from the fields of regenerative medicine and gene therapy, are opening exciting avenues for direct modulation of immune or tumor cells in situ, widening our strategies to remove cancer immunotherapy roadblocks. Here, we review current strategies for cancer immunotherapy, summarize technologies for generation of immune cells by cell fate reprogramming as well as highlight the future potential of inducing these unique cell identities in vivo, providing new and exciting tools for the fast-paced field of cancer immunotherapy.","CAR-T; antigen presentation; cancer immunotherapy; cancer vaccine; cellular reprogramming; dendritic cell; transcription factor; tumor immunology","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","en","Review"

They originate from the de-differentiation of differentiated somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), or from the differentiation of undifferentiated cells. They show a limited capacity to differentiate and a morphology similar to that of somatic cell stem cells present in tissues, but distinct from that of iPSCs and ESCs. iTSCs can be generally obtained 7 to 10 days after reprogramming of somatic cells with Yamanaka’s factors, and their fibroblast-like morphology remains unaltered. iTSCs can also be obtained directly from iPSCs cultured under conditions allowing cellular differentiation. In this case, to effectively induce iTSCs, additional treatment is required, as exemplified by the conversion of iPSCs into naïve iPSCs. iTSCs can proliferate continuously in vitro, but when transplanted into immunocompromised mice, they fail to generate solid tumors (teratomas), implying loss of tumorigenic potential. The low tendency of iTSCs to elicit tumors is beneficial, especially considering applications for regenerative medicine in humans. Several iTSC types have been identified, including iTS-L, iTS-P, and iTS-D, obtained by reprogramming hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, and deciduous tooth-derived dental pulp cells, respectively. This review provides a brief overview of iPSCs and discusses recent advances in the establishment of iTSCs and their possible applications in regenerative medicine.","epiblast stem cells; induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); induced tissue-specific stem cells (iTSCs); insulin-producing cells; naïve stem cells; partial reprogramming","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","en","Review"

Reflecting in vivo development, organoids form from tissue cells or pluripotent stem cells. Cues provided from the media and individual cells promote self-organization of these uniform starting cells into a structure, with emergent differentiated cells, morphology, and often functionality that resemble the tissue of origin. Therefore, organoids provide a complement to two-dimensional in vitro culture and in vivo animal models of development, providing the experimental control and flexibility of in vitro methods with the three-dimensional context of in vivo models, with fewer ethical restraints than human or animal work. However, using organoids, we are only just beginning to understand on the cellular level how the external conditions and signaling between individual cells promote the emergence of cells and structures. In this review, we focus specifically on organoids derived from endodermal tissues: the starting conditions of the cells, signaling mechanisms, and external media that allow the emergence of higher order self-organization.","Emergence; Intestine; Liver; Lungs; Pancreas; Prostate","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","en","Review"

This notwithstanding, the regulation of the cell cycle is often assumed to be generic, independent of tissue or developmental stage. Here we review developmental-stage-specific cell cycle adaptations that may influence developmental decisions, in mammalian erythropoiesis and in other lineages. The length of the cell cycle influences the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in multiple tissues, and may determine lineage fate. Shorter cycles contribute to the efficiency of reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotency stem cells and help maintain the pluripotent state. While the plasticity of G1 length is well established, the speed of S phase is emerging as a novel regulated parameter that may influence cell fate transitions in the erythroid lineage, in neural tissue and in embryonic stem cells. A slow S phase may stabilize the self-renewal state, whereas S phase shortening may favor a cell fate change. In the erythroid lineage, functional approaches and single-cell RNA-sequencing show that a key transcriptional switch, at the transition from self-renewal to differentiation, is synchronized with and dependent on S phase. This specific S phase is shorter, as a result of a genome-wide increase in the speed of replication forks. Furthermore, there is progressive shortening in G1 in the period preceding this switch. Together these studies suggest an integrated regulatory landscape of the cycle and differentiation programs, where cell cycle adaptations are controlled by, and in turn feed back on, the propagation of developmental trajectories.

Specifically, chromatin undergoes a binary off/on switch during iPSC reprogramming, closing and opening loci occupied by somatic and pluripotency transcription factors, respectively. This logic of a binary off/on switch may also be operational in cell fate control during normal development and implies that further approaches could potentially be developed to direct cell fate changes both in vitro and in vivo.","chromatin dynamics; reprogramming; stem cell","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","en","Review"

In this review, we summarize the response to environmental stresses (hypoxic, oxidative, thermal, and mechanical stresses) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their applications in the differentiation methods directed to specific lineages. Those stresses lead to activation of each specific transcription factor followed by the induction of downstream genes, and one of them regulates lineage specification. In short, hypoxic stress promotes the differentiation of ESCs to mesodermal lineages via HIF-1α activation. Concerning mechanical stress, high stiffness tends to promote mesodermal differentiation, while low stiffness promotes ectodermal differentiation via the modulation of YAP1. Furthermore, each step in the same lineage differentiation favors each appropriate stiffness of culture plate; for example, definitive endoderm favors high stiffness, while pancreatic progenitor favors low stiffness during pancreatic differentiation of human ESCs. Overall, treatments utilizing those stresses have no genotoxic or carcinogenic effects except oxidative stress; therefore, the differentiated cells are safe and could be useful for cell replacement therapy. In particular, the effect of mechanical stress on differentiation is becoming attractive for the field of regenerative medicine. Therefore, the development of a stress-mediated differentiation protocol is an important matter for the future.","differentiation; embryonic stem cells; hypoxic stress; induced pluripotent stem cells; mechanical stress; oxidative stress; stress response; thermal stress","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","en","Review"

Recent advances in platform technologies have made cell editing achievable; this includes generation of induced pluripotent stem cells and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, as well as direct cell reprogramming. mRNA, as compared to DNA, is an excellent tool for potentiating cell editing technologies, owing to its distinct properties in gene introduction. Herein, hepatocytes were edited ex vivo and in vivo, by introducing pro-survival mRNA, to be resistant to cell death. DNA-based introduction of pro-survival gene poses safety concerns due to its genomic integration, as prolonged and uncontrolled expression of pro-survival proteins after the integration may promote cancer. In contrast, mRNA lacks such a risk. Moreover, mRNA-based introduction of Bcl-2, a pro-survival factor, was more effective in preventing the death of cultured hepatocytes than Bcl-2 plasmid DNA (pDNA) introduction. Mechanistically, mRNA induced protein expression in a larger percentage of the hepatocytes compared to pDNA, presumably because the process of pDNA nuclear entry in transfection is challenging. In hepatocyte transplantation to mouse liver, ex vivo introduction of Bcl-2 mRNA significantly improved the engraftment efficiency of the hepatocytes, leading to successful functional support of the liver in a mouse model of chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, in vivo administration of Bcl-2 mRNA exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect on the hepatocytes of a mouse model of fulminant hepatitis. These results demonstrate the potential advantages of mRNA introduction over DNA introduction in cell editing.","cell editing; cell transplantation; fulminant hepatitis; hepatocyte; mRNA therapeutics; pro-survival factor","","","ja","Review"

Such changes raise concerns for the safety of PSC-derived cellular therapies for regenerative medicine. Although acquired genetic changes may not be present in a cell line at the start of a research programme, the low sensitivity of current detection methods means that mutations may be difficult to detect if they arise but are present in only a small proportion of the cells. In this Review, we discuss the types of mutations acquired by human PSCs and the mechanisms that lead to their accumulation. Recent work suggests that the underlying mutation rate in PSCs is low, although they also seem to be particularly susceptible to genomic damage. This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by the observations that, in contrast to somatic cells, PSCs are programmed to die in response to genomic damage, which may reflect the requirements of early embryogenesis. Thus, the common genetic variants that are observed are probably rare events that give the cells with a selective growth advantage.","","","","en","Review"

Both fate decisions are strongly regulated at the molecular level via intricate signaling pathways. The regulation of signaling networks promoting self-renewal or differentiation was thought to be largely governed by the action of transcription factors. However, small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as vault RNAs, and their post-transcriptional modifications (the epitranscriptome) have emerged as additional regulatory layers with essential roles in SC fate decisions. RNA post-transcriptional modifications often modulate RNA stability, splicing, processing, recognition, and translation. Furthermore, modifications on small ncRNAs allow for dual regulation of RNA activity, at both the level of biogenesis and RNA-mediated actions. RNA post-transcriptional modifications act through structural alterations and specialized RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) called writers, readers, and erasers. It is through SC-context RBPs that the epitranscriptome coordinates specific functional roles. Small ncRNA post-transcriptional modifications are today exploited by different mechanisms to facilitate SC translational studies. One mechanism readily being studied is identifying how SC-specific RBPs of small ncRNAs regulate fate decisions. Another common practice of using the epitranscriptome for regenerative applications is using naturally occurring post-transcriptional modifications on synthetic RNA to generate induced pluripotent SCs. Here, we review exciting insights into how small ncRNA post-transcriptional modifications control SC fate decisions in development and disease. We hope, by illustrating how essential the epitranscriptome and their associated proteome are in SCs, they would be considered as novel tools to propagate SCs for regenerative medicine.","adult stem cells; cancer stem cells; epigenetics; epitranscriptome; microRNAs; noncoding RNAs","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","en","Review"

Ensuing this, various groups have used genetic and non-genetic approaches to generate iPSCs from numerous cell types. However, achieving a pluripotent state in most of the reprogramming studies is marred by serious limitations such as low reprogramming efficiency and slow kinetics. These limitations are mainly due to the presence of potent barriers that exist during reprogramming when a mature cell is coaxed to achieve a pluripotent state. Several studies have revealed that intrinsic factors such as non-optimal stoichiometry of reprogramming factors, specific signaling pathways, cellular senescence, pluripotency-inhibiting transcription factors and microRNAs act as a roadblock. In addition, the epigenetic state of somatic cells and specific epigenetic modifications that occur during reprogramming also remarkably impede the generation of iPSCs. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the barriers that inhibit reprogramming and the understanding of which will pave the way to develop safe strategies for efficient reprogramming.","Cell reprogramming; Epigenetics; Reprogramming barriers/roadblocks; Transcription factors; induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","","","en","Review"

They are particularly useful for studying human disease mechanisms in vitro by making it possible to circumvent the ethical issues of human embryonic stem cell research. However, significant limitations exist when using conventional flat culturing methods especially concerning cell expansion, differentiation efficiency, stability maintenance and multicellular 3D structure establishment, differentiation prediction. Embryoid bodies (EBs), the multicellular aggregates spontaneously generated from iPSCs in the suspension system, might help to address these issues. Due to the unique microenvironment and cell communication in EB structure that a 2D culture system cannot achieve, EBs have been widely applied in hiPSC-derived differentiation and show significant advantages especially in scaling up culturing, differentiation efficiency enhancement, ex vivo simulation, and organoid establishment. EBs can potentially also be used in early prediction of iPSC differentiation capability. To improve the stability and feasibility of EB-mediated differentiation and generate high quality EBs, critical factors including iPSC pluripotency maintenance, generation of uniform morphology using micro-pattern 3D culture systems, proper cellular density inoculation, and EB size control are discussed on the basis of both published data and our own laboratory experiences. Collectively, the production of a large quantity of homogeneous EBs with high quality is important for the stability and feasibility of many PSCs related studies.","Committed differentiation; Early prediction; Embryoid body; Heterogeneity; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Quality control; Scaling-up; Suspension culture; Three-dimensional culture","","","en","Review"
